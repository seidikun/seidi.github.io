We built a pipeline of brain-machine interface (BMI) classification algorithms training and validation. The pipeline is
based on an open-source dataset, from which we used a subset containing up to 11 sessions of 2 classes of motor imagery
training (right-hand and left-hand) from 17 subjects. We tested three main classes of algorithms: traditional (Common Spatial Patterns with Linear Discriminant Analysis and Common Spatial Patterns with Support Vector Machine), Riemannian (Minimum Distance to the Mean and Tangent Space classifiers), and deep learning (EEGNet). While traditional and Riemannian Minimum Distance to the Mean did not classify the data significantly over the chance level (50% accuracy), the Tangential Space classifier and the deep learning model achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 68.6% +/- 13.1% and 73.3% +/- 16.1%, respectively, showing their expected good results for use in BMI signal processing. All algorithms could be trained in under three minutes, which is an adequate time for a BMI experiment. We hope to extend this pipeline to different algorithms and more data. A crucial next step is to test the best algorithm in an online experiment.
